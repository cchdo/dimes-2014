      <p>DIMES is a US/UK field program aimed at measuring diapycnal and isopycnal mixing in the Southern Ocean, along the tilting isopycnals of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</p>
      <p>The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) of the ocean is a critical regulator of the Earth's climate processes. Climate models are highly sensitive to the representation of mixing processes in the southern limb of the MOC, within the Southern Ocean, although the lack of extensive in situ observations of Southern Ocean mixing processes has made evaluation of mixing somewhat difficult. Theories and models of the Southern Ocean circulation have been built on the premise of adiabatic flow in the ocean interior, with diabatic processes confined to the upper-ocean mixed layer. Interior diapycnal mixing has often been assumed to be small, but a few recent studies have suggested that diapycnal mixing might be large in some locations, particularly over rough bathymetry. Depending on its extent, this interior diapycnal mixing could significantly affect the overall energetics and property balances for the Southern Ocean and in turn for the global ocean. The goals of DIMES are to obtain measurements that will help us quantify both along-isopycnal eddy-driven mixing and cross-isopycnal interior mixing.</p>

      <p>Schematic representation of Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation. The isopycnal upwelling of Upper and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW and LCDW, with sources in the North Atlantic) is supported by mean geostrophic mass fluxes below the level of topographic obstacles to the ACC and by mesoscale eddy-driven mass fluxes at mid-depth. The upwelled water changes density through air-sea-ice interaction. It then returns northward in the wind-driven Ekman layer to form Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in mean geostrophic flows. The magnitude of interior diapycnal mixing and the rate of along-isopycnal mixing are open for investigation and are the DIMES objectives.</p>
      <p>DIMES includes tracer release, isopycnal following RAFOS floats, microstructure measurements, shearmeter floats, EM-APEX floats, a mooring array in Drake Passage, hydrographic observations, inverse modeling, and analysis of altimetry and numerical model output.</p>

      <h4>Version 4</h4>

      <p>
      The Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES) is
      a US and UK oceanographic process study that is collecting a broad range of
      data types. This document outlines the basic principles of data sharing within
      the DIMES project:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
        DIMES recognizes the rights of individual investigators to analyze and publish
        first results from the data sets for which they had primary responsibility.  
        </li>
        <li>
        In order to maximize scientific gains from DIMES, investigators will need
        access to all DIMES data sets or processed data products from other DIMES
        investigators (such as diffusivity estimates, mapped fields or analyzed
        trajectories).  This requires that we share data efficiently.  DIMES data
        should be posted on the DIMES web sites as early as possible, with clear
        documentation.  Preliminary data sets should be posted and denoted as such.
        They should be checked for quality, revised, and finalized as early as
        possible, by the originator.  
        </li>
        <li>
        Data sharing is managed by the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office
        (CCHDO), which maintains a separate web site and password protected data site
        specifically for DIMES.  The center can manage version control for evolving
        data sets and can help in developing standard formats to report meta data, raw
        (level 0) data, and refined data fields.  
        </li>
        <li>
        Primary investigators of each shared data type retain primary publication
        rights for their data.  During the preliminary DIMES analysis work, if other
        DIMES investigators wish to publish results based on these data, then they must
        offer co-authorship to the data originators, whose names are identified with
        the data products on the DIMES data web site.  More importantly, they must work
        with the data originators to ensure that they are not replicating work being
        conducted by someone else and that they are interpreting the data correctly.
        This policy should continue to the extent allowed by the funding agencies
        beyond the two-year period during which data are not yet made public, except
        that after the two year period it would apply to anyone wishing to work with
        the data.  This restriction or request should be in a statement accompanying
        the data wherever the data are posted.  When the originator of the data wishes
        to offer free use of data without consultation, or perhaps with only
        attribution, that should be announced in a statement with the data.  If data
        are produced by a team of investigators, all members of the team should be
        consulted before the data are shared with other investigators.
        </li>
        <li>
        Numerical model output also plays a key role in DIMES analysis, and can be
        released through the data web site or via other channels, as appropriate.
        Users of numerical output should follow the same guidelines with respect to the
        originator as they would with originators of observational data.  The same
        policy applies to intermediate products that have been provided to assist with
        field operations and analysis of observational data.
        </li>
        <li>
        Data use agreements should be documented at a minimum in emails.
        </li>
        <li>
        Any individual who has received grant funding or salary support to participate
        in DIMES is to be considered a DIMES investigator, including principal
        investigators, co-investigators, technical staff, post-docs, and graduate
        students.
        </li>
        <li>
        The interests of graduate students and post-doctoral associates working with a
        particular data set must be considered in agreements between principal
        investigators on those data.
        </li>
        <li>
        For the first two years after data collection, DIMES data should only be shared
        among DIMES investigators.  After two years, sharing with the larger U.S. and
        U.K. communities is mandated by the funding agencies.
        </li>
        <li>
        Everyone involved in DIMES is expected to make a good faith effort to adhere to
        the above points of data sharing policy.  In the unlikely event that
        adjudication is required, the lead PIs, Jim Ledwell and Alberto Naveira
        Garabato, will appoint an ad-hoc committee of three researchers, likely drawn
        from DIMES PIs, to evaluate the situation and provide a ruling.

      <p>
      Following NSF and NERC guidelines, all DIMES data will ultimately be reported
      to the US National Ocean Data Center, National Geophysical Data Center, and/or
      the British Oceanographic Data Centre, who will take responsibility for
      archiving the data.  In the case of NSF the normal period after which
      publication of the data is required is two years.  Exceptions are allowed only
      with permission of the cognizant program manager.  However, it seems allowable
      and prudent after the data are made public to ask, in a statement accompanying
      the data, potential users to consult with the originators before using the
      data.
